title: Responsiveness
---

Built with the emerging market of portable devices in mind, responsive styling is a core feature of glaze. Concepts outlined below are based on a mobile-first approach popularized by [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/).

Style props accept arrays, denoting value changes triggered by breakpoints.

- The first value is applied by default.
- Subsequent values are applied when passing through a given screen size.

Undefined values or sparse array-like objects may also be used.
